#  ****  Data Structure Into  ****

# Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data
#  in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored
#  data more efficiently. ... Data structures are being used in almost
#  every program or software system that has been developed.

# ***  8 Common Data type every Programmer must know  ***

# The basic Python data types in Python include

# Here are the available types in Python. Use type() to find out what
# type your object is.

# Text Type     :	str
# Numeric Types :	int, float, complex
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type  :	dictionaries
# Set Types     :	set, frozenset
# Boolean Type  :	bool
# Binary Types  :	bytes, bytearray, memoryview


# Examples of types:

# Strings: "This is a string"
#   		 'This is also a string'
#     	 """
#          Triple quotes allow you to have multi-line strings and are
#          useful for automatically escaping "single quotes"
#
#
#          """

# Integers: 	1
#   			12345678901234567890

# Python 3 can represent huge numbers
# Use 0letter# to specify integers in other bases. Letters
# are: b for binary, o for octal, x or X for hexadecimal

# 0b10 = 2 in binary, 0o10 = 8 in octal, 0x10 = 16 in hexadecimal


#   **** Things to look out for in a data type ****

#   all data structures have the following in common

#   Access : How can it be accessed  ?
#   Change : How can we update data within the data structure ?
#   Add    : How can we add items to the data structure ?
#   Remove : How can we remove items to the data structure?
#   Loop   : How can we loop throught the data structure ?
#   Sort   : can we sort it ?
#   Copy   : can we copy it ?
#   Join   :  How do we join it to similar ones?

my_year_of_birth = "1880"
this_year = 2021

my_age = this_year - int(my_year_of_birth)
print(my_age)

# plastic , aluminum, plastic bucket with holes

#  List, tupple, String , set
